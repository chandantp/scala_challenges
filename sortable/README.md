### Notes

* The solution is written in Scala
* For building and running the Scala program, SBT is required.
* To install SBT, run **./installSBT.sh**
* In case of issues with SBT installation, refer to http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html
* For running the program, execute **./run.sh**
* The results file **"results.txt"** is generated in the current directory

### Caveat
* DO NOT USE OPEN JDK!
* Please use Oracle JDK 1.8 as SBT does not play nice with Open JDK
